# from command line
apt-get install python-opencv
# NOTE: Above worked for 64bit raspbien. For 32bit, use apt-get install python3-opencv

# When I installed, I had not updated the OS so had to run this after initial install failed
# sudo apt --fix-missing update
# sudo apt-get -f python-opencv  (NOTE: -f force the installation of the broken packages)
