1) Simplify the html by using more bulma styles, and less inline styles
2) Make the various components and buttons aware of each other.
3) Design some kind of on/off, help metaphore. For instance, have a static image in the
left window that signifies off, when off, or the actual video when on.
4) Provide some kind of status info into the page so that we can track various system
parameters.
